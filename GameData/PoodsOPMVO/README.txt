Poodmund's Outer Planets Mod - Visual Overhaul

---

1.	- About

Pood's OPM-VO is a graphical overhaul modification for Kerbal Space Program's additional planet/moon mod, Outer Planets Mod, that is developed by CaptRobau & Eudae55. Pood's OPM-VO builds upon the OPM mod by adding additional atmospheric and cloud effects using original artwork through the following mods: Environmental Visual Enhancements by rbray89, Scatterer by Blackrack, Module Manager by Sarbian and Kopernicus by Thomas P.

2.	- Features

- New Gas Giant colour maps
- Cloud layers on Atmosphere bodies
- Scatterer configs for Atmospheric bodies
- Auroras where relevant
- Volumetric cloud layers
- Surface fog/dust
- Heavy, dark Hydrocarbon Seas on Tekto
- Storms on Tekto (planned)
- Suggest more!

3.	- Known Issues

- Gas Giant Scatterer effects are not included at this time as Scatterer causes nulRefs and FPS to drop dramatically when loaded around a Gas Giant (Blackrack is aware of this issue).
- Volumetric particles don't tile "brilliantly" and you may see edge tiling in some areas.
- Scatterer can sometimes cause saturated bands of colour to appear at Sunrise/Sunset, this is probably due to bad configs on my end.

4.	- How to Install

Extract the GameData folder found in the downloadable .zip directly into your Kerbal Space Program install directory. If located correctly, the PoodsOPMVO directory should be found at:

Drive:\*\Kerbal Space Program\GameData\PoodsOPMVO

5.	- Dependancies

The following KSP mods must be installed prior to using PoodsOPMVO for it to function correctly (KSP Forum links attached):

6.	- Warnings

PoodsOPMVO utilises many very hi-res textures and therefore can increase system RAM usage to the point where it may cause KSP to crash unexpectedly when run through a 32bit launcher (pre KSP v1.1). It is advisable if using PoodsOPMVO to run a discrete GPU and also KSP in OpenGL to offload the texture caching to the GPU's VRAM. If running KSP through a 64bit launcher, this shoudl not be an issue if your system has a large amount of system RAM.
