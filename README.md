# Poodmund's Outer Planets Mod - Visual Overhaul

### 1 - About

Pood's OPM-VO is a graphical overhaul modification for Kerbal Space Program's additional planet/moon mod, Outer Planets Mod, that is developed by CaptRobau & Eudae55. Pood's OPM-VO builds upon the OPM mod by adding additional atmospheric and cloud effects using original artwork through the following mods: Environmental Visual Enhancements by rbray89, Scatterer by Blackrack, Module Manager by Sarbian and Kopernicus by Thomas P.

### 2 - Features

- New Gas Giant colour maps
- Cloud layers on Atmosphere bodies
- Scatterer configs for Atmospheric bodies
- Auroras where relevant
- Volumetric cloud layers
- Surface fog/dust
- Heavy, dark Hydrocarbon Seas on Tekto
- Storms on Tekto (planned)
- Sigma OPM-Tilt support for Urlum
- Procedural Gas Giants textures on Sarnus and Neidon from Kopernicus Expansion
- Suggest more!

### 3 - Known Issues

- Gas Giant Scatterer effects are not included at this time as Scatterer causes nulRefs and FPS to drop dramatically when loaded around a Gas Giant (Blackrack is aware of this issue).
- Volumetric particles don't tile "brilliantly" and you may see edge tiling in some areas.
- Scatterer can sometimes cause saturated bands of colour to appear at Sunrise/Sunset, this is probably due to bad configs on my end.
- At this time it may cause some other Cloud/Texture/Visual packs to function incorrectly, if this is the case, please let me know as soon as possible so that I can try to rectify the issue.
- With Kopernicus Expansion the Gas Giants' texture maps may appear to be mirrored vertically, this isn't necessarily horrible but is known about.

### 4 - How to Install

Extract the GameData folder found in the downloadable .zip directly into your Kerbal Space Program install directory. If located correctly, the PoodsOPMVO directory should be found at:

Drive:\*\Kerbal Space Program\GameData\PoodsOPMVO

### 5 - Dependencies

The following KSP mods must be installed prior to using PoodsOPMVO for it to function correctly (KSP Forum links attached):

### 6 - Warnings

PoodsOPMVO utilises many very hi-res textures and therefore can increase system RAM usage to the point where it may cause KSP to crash unexpectedly when run through a 32bit launcher (pre KSP v1.1). It is advisable if using PoodsOPMVO to run a discrete GPU and also KSP in OpenGL to offload the texture caching to the GPU's VRAM. If running KSP through a 64bit launcher, this should not be an issue if your system has a large amount of system RAM.

### 7 - Changelog
